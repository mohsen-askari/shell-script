Shell scripting exercises
Mr. Arash Foroughi's course at Sematec Academy


Here are brief descriptions for each of the provided exercises:

1. **User Interaction and File Operations Bash Script:**
   This Bash script interacts with the user, gathering their name and age. It then creates a directory, generates files, and performs operations such as changing file permissions, copying, and deleting files.

2. **Find Maximum and Minimum in an Array:**
   This Bash script defines functions to find the maximum and minimum values in an array of numbers. It takes 20 user-input numbers, processes them, and displays the largest and smallest numbers.

3. **Server Configuration Transfer:**
   The script facilitates the transfer of configuration files to a remote server. It checks if the server is pingable, and if so, transfers the "/etc/passwd" file. The script provides appropriate messages based on success or failure.

4. **Print Numbers in a Range:**
   This Bash script uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 5 to 50. It showcases the basic usage of loops in Bash for generating and displaying a series of numbers.

5. **Periodic User Data Extraction:**
   The script creates an output directory, captures the current date, and extracts specific user data from "/etc/passwd" at regular intervals. It also includes functionality to remove files older than two days from the specified directory.

6. **System Welcome Information:**
   The script displays a welcome message to the logged-in user, shows today's date, and indicates the number of users currently logged into the system. It provides basic system information upon user login.

7. **IP Ping Logger:**
   This script logs ping results for a list of IP addresses provided in a file. It checks the existence of the IP file, creates a log directory, and logs ping results, including the hostname, organized by date and hostname.

8. **DevOps Fundamentals Practice Exercise:**
   This exercise is designed for a DevOps fundamentals course. It covers version control, scripting, automation, configuration management, continuous integration, and system administration. Participants engage in tasks to reinforce key DevOps principles and practices.
